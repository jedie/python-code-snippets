PyLucid is a lightweight, OpenSource ( GPL 2.x or newer ) content management
system ( CMS ) written in Python using django . Nearly all output can be
customized. No shell account is needed. You only need a standard webserver
with Python (at least v2.4) CGI and one supported database (MySQL, SQLite3,
Postgre, Oracle and MS-SQL)to run PyLucid.
