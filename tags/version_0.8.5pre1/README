PyLucid is a Open Source content management system (CMS) written in Python
using Django.

A web based install is implemented, so no shell account is needed! You only
need a standard webserver with Python (at least v2.4) CGI and one of the
supported database engines (MySQL, SQLite3, Postgre, Oracle and MS-SQL) to run
PyLucid.

Nearly all output can be customized.

PyLucid/django are WSGI conform, so you can run it as CGI, fastCGI, mod_Python
and others...
