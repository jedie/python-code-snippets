# PyLucid .htaccess file

# You can easy change the rewrite tule to use fastCGI, see below.
#
# Note:
#    You should be carefull uncomment settings.
#    It can be that not all rules are permitted!
#    If you activate a "not allowed" rule, the server can send a
#    "500 internal server error" for every request!
#    The best way: uncomment one after another and check a request/response
#     after every step.
