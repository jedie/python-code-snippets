= Python web test =

Detect web handler: mod_wsgi, fast_CGI, fcgid, mod_python or CGI and display many informations.

* **python_test.py** displays many informations.
* **python_test_mini.py** is smaller and displays less informations.


== HowTo ==

Put the files **.htaccess**, **python_test.py** and/or **python_test_mini.py** into
your htdocs directory. Change .htaccess for your needs.


=== SCGI ===

The test script can run a SCGI Server, too. It's use the [[http://trac.saddi.com/flup|flup]] packages for this.
To start a SCGI Server on {{{ localhost:4000 }}} run this:
{{{
./python_test.py scgi
}}}
or specify bidn address and port:
{{{
./python_test.py scgi 127.0.0.1 8888
}}}

Add SCGIMount to your VirtualHost config, e.g.:
{{{
<VirtualHost>
    ... 
    SCGIMount / 127.0.0.1:4000
    ...
</VirtualHost>
}}}


== logging ==

The test script write some logs into a log file. The problem is, to find a place
for this log file. Depending on the user that runs the process, we have different
file write rights and we try to find a filepath in which we can write out log output.

We try to create a log file in these directories:
* same directory as test script
* tempfile.gettempdir()
* ~/tmp
* /tmp


== Which handler? ==

How to find out what the handler is running script?


=== mod_wsgi ===

{{{
if __name__.startswith('_mod_wsgi_'):
    # we running with mod_wsgi
}}}
or:
{{{
if sys.argv[0] == "mod_wsgi":
    # we running with mod_wsgi
}}}
see also: https://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/TipsAndTricks#Determining_If_Running_Under_mod_wsgi


=== mod_python ===

{{{
if __name__.startswith('_mp_'):
    # we running with mod_python
}}}
or:
{{{
if sys.argv[0] == "mod_python":
    # we running with mod_python
}}}


=== SCGI ===

This have i seen on the internet, but not tested:
{{{
if sys.argv[0] == "scgi-wsgi":
    # we running with SCGI
}}}
(See SCGI section above.)


=== fastCGI, fcgid or CGI ? ===

It seems to be difficult to keep them apart. The current solution looks like this:
{{{
if __name__ == "__main__":
    if "CGI" in os.environ.get("GATEWAY_INTERFACE", ""):
        # normal CGI
    elif "PATH" in os.environ:
        # New libapache2-mod-fcgid Apache module
    else:
        # Old libapache2-mod-fastcgi Apache module
}}}

Does anyone have a better idea?
